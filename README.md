# Canteen Management System

This project is done as a part of our DBMS Course in S5 BTech in National Institute of Technology, Calicut. The project aims to create a unified canteen management system which can be used in a canteen system like the one present in NITC. There are two types of users who can use this database system:
  - Canteen Administrator
  - Canteen User

### Canteen Administrator
A Canteen admin can use this management system to keep track of monthly users of the respective canteens and their extras expenditure. A unified EXTRAS database stores the
price of all common extras used in canteen. The admin can use the interface provided to update the expenditures of the users daily.

### Canteen User
A canteen user can use the management system to know his canteen details and monthly expenses.
